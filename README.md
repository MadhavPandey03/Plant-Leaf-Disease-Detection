<h1> Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection</h1>
<h2>  Description</h2>
This dataset is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found here.This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.

Note: This description is given in the dataset itself

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
Goal is clear and simple. We need to build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
ResNets perform significantly well for image classification when some of the parameters are tweaked and techniques like scheduling learning rate, gradient clipping and weight decay are applied. The model is able to predict every image in test set perfectly without any errors !!!!
